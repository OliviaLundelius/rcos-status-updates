## Last Week's Accomplishments

All parts ordered have been received.  Had to order a different solenoid because the first one ordered wasn't marked as being 
measured by radius rather than diameter so it was twice the size I needed. New solenoid doesn't have a datasheet, but that's fine
because we figured out how it works.  
Arduino just needs to send a high or low signal to the solenoid, which is nice.  
Got the non-open-source model printed, it looks terrible and is slightly smaller than it should be but it's fine for taking measurements
to construct a similar model.  

## This Week's Plan

Liz will make the model because she's been learning how to use NX, so I'll modify the working script to work with the arduino.  

## Anything Blocking?

Still not sure what to do about pressurized air, but that's fine for now.
