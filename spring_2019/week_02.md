## Last Week's Accomplishments

Missed last week's status update, whoops.  
Solidified plans to work on both a conveyor belt based sorter and air puff based sorter and purchased supplies.  
Found a better suited hopper model online.  Still not open source (this one was creative commons), but I'll probably end up  
making a new model anyways.  
Some supplies got sent to California somehow, but they're on their way now.  

## This Week's Plan

Print hopper, figure out how solenoid works, and tinker with supplies.  

## Anything Blocking?

Very difficult to get a supply of compressed air which isn't industrial sized or overly expensive, typically both.  
Might be able to get something smaller and more easily dealt with from an air rifle dealership.  

## Notes

Recently realized that iNaturalist is open source. If I can, I'll try to teach myself about how it works and make some small  
contributions to that.
