## Last Week's Accomplishments

We've decided to move towards using a conveyor belt instead of a rotating sorting device.  
The conveyor belt will have an air puff to puff out concentrate, and certain quantities of material will be put back into the sorting process
to increase accuracy.  
I've found a couple of existing hoppers that may be of use, but there are no licenses attached, so I'd have to make one myself for 3D printing.  
This weekend I'll be making a hopper out of posterboard.  
I also found a vibratory bowl feeder model, but didn't check the license, so I'll have to hunt that down as well.  
Current state of the shape discrimination algorithm is broken and leaving me confused so I'll have to read more about what I'm doing...  

## This Week's Plan

Understand properly how contours and shape detection generally work.  
Have assembled a hopper, maybe printed some of the vibratory bowl feeder parts and found some way of vibrating the bowl feeder.  

## Anything Blocking?

Still little to no experience with machine learning and mech-E, but getting there slowly.  

## Notes

Have been suffering through assignments and exams these last couple of weeks, this week should be calmer.
