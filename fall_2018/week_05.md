## Last Week's Accomplishments

Made a hopper out of posterboard, have been trying to fiddle with a model of a vibratory bowl feeder but I might just print it as it is.  
Have mostly scrapped a lot of the machine learning stuff I was doing previously in favor now of following instructions for OCR, which
 would maybe be helpful eventually in the event I wanted to also have the program distinguish between kinds of fossils. That's going fine so far.  

## This Week's Plan

Hopefully continue working on the OCR program.  
3D print the vibratory bowl feeder.  

## Anything Blocking?

A number of assignments, but shouldn't be too bad. Should be able to put more work into this this week.
