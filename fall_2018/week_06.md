## Last Week's Accomplishments

(Forgot to post for a couple of weeks, so I'll summarize what I did for each week based on my notebook notes)  
Found some library functions that may be of use through a tutorial on recognizing hand signals.
Was also looking into how these weights are supposed to be stored and saved.  
Discovered that the SVM classifier doesn't actually work, so that needs to be fixed.  
Kind of confused, it's almost the same as the demo I wrote a while ago, but it crashes the whole program.  


## This Week's Plan
  
3D print the vibratory bowl feeder.  
Fix the SVM?  

## Anything Blocking?
