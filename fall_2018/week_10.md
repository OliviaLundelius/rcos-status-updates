## Accomplishments

Most recently, we've been working on trying to figure out why almost none of the packages are working properly or installing on raspbian.  
We believe now that it is a versioning issue caused by conflicting packages which came with raspbian and different pip/pip3 versions.  
We have to figure out what packages need to be uninstalled/reinstalled and in what order, and with what package manager and what versions of each.  
The latest versions of numpy, scipy and pip version 18 should be correct, but I need to check again what version OpenCV should be.  
Same goes for progressbar/progressbar2.  
  
Over the last semester, we've made a lot of progress in narrowing down what needs to be done mechanically.  
Initially, we had basically no direction, but we now have a clear vision regarding what methods we need to test and choose from.  
We now have some really nice documentation of methods which currently exist and I've learned significantly more about OpenCV, scikit-learn and how the current program works and how to extend it.  
I've made minimal progress in debugging the SVM method, but I now know how models are saved and loaded back into the program.  


## Future Plans

Next semester will be focused a lot more on improving the UI, creating a binary output for use by the electronics, and designing hardware.

I plan on submitting this project once again to the Association for Materials and Methods in Paleontology to present and let them know what's been going on with it.  
This will unfortunately require me to take April 19th (and possibly 18th) off, but I think it will be worth it.  
It will also be excellent motivation to work especially hard over the summer, during which I'll have even more time to work on it.  

## Anything Blocking?

Next semester, I'll be an RCOS coordinator and taking 21 credits, of which RCOS is only 1.  
Most likely, I won't be able to put very much time into this project or any others.
