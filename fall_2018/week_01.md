## Last Week's Accomplishments

Decided on who was going to be working on what aspects of the project
Teaching other project members about the current state of the project in different aspects
Acquisition of more electronics for new project members to work with

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
Look into shape identification algorithms and decide on approaches
Generate more training/testing data
Go to RPI Forge and Embedded Hardware clubs to see if anyone has any advice for how to proceed hardware-wise
Learn how to 3D model things
> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

No idea how to approach shape regression/whatever, guess I'm gonna learn! Maybe an SVM will work?
Also have absolutely zero knowledge about mechanical engineering and dealing with hardware
Minimal experience in 3D modelling

## Notes

... I'm not grading myself am I, because that would feel very broken
