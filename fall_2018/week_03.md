## Last Week's Accomplishments

This last week, I looked into different existing open source models of hoppers for various applications like paintball, coffee machines
and general purpose hoppers.  
I also began looking into conveyor belts and how they might be useful in reducing the need to force the hopper to output exactly one
specimen at a time.  
I asked a friend to print a hopper for me, but it resulted in a plastic mess, so I think I'll just give up and pay for a decent quality
print through the Forge.  
I also started looking more seriously at shape/contour recognition. I may be able to make use of the HuMoments function from cv2.  

## This Week's Plan

Write a prototype shape recognition algorithm.  
Get at least two of hoppers printed to test out.  
Research more about controlling air puffs.  

## Anything Blocking?

Minimal experience in machine learning and the cv2 libary and zero experience in mechanical engineering, yay!  
Also have a large exam on Monday.  

## Notes

Not in particular
