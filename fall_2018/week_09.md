## Last Week's Accomplishments

Made a function for discriminating based on contour.  
Doesn't work at all yet but I'm slowly modifying it to fit in with the rest of the approach functions.  
Wanted to get work done over thanksgiving break but didn't have time, unfortunately.  
Learning about something called HOG, or histogram of gradients.  

## This Week's Plan

Understand HOG and contours  
Fix SVM approach  

## Anything Blocking?

Will be assisting with the Candy Cane Hackathon soon, which will take up time.  
Also large group project due soon.  
Project-related, have no idea what I'm doing but getting there.
