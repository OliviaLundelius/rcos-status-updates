## Last Week's Accomplishments

Did a lot of reading about CV2 and tensorflow libraries.  
Haven't been able to do terribly much due to an upcoming test.  
Visited the Embedded Hardware club and RPI Forge to see what each have to offer.  

## This Week's Plan

Will be learning about 3D modelling and trying to design a piece of hardware.  
Will write some kind of preliminary shape discrimination algorithm.  

## Anything Blocking?

Have big tests tomorrow and next week so that will take up a lot of my time.  


## Notes
